Trip Optimize (TO) is a smart cruise-control system for trains that considers terrain, train make-up, 
speed restrictions and operating conditions to calculate an optimum speed profile. It then automatically controls locomotive throttle and dynamic brakes to reduce fuel burn and provide efficient train handling.
With Trip Optimizer, trains run on time, operate more smoothly, and use fuel more efficiently â€“ resulting in fuel savings and corresponding emissions reduction.
